# API
(I am currently working on a better version, you can check it out on the branch "development")
This API code allows for a connection to be made between two instances of our [Driver](https://github.com/Shaking-Hands-Overseas/SHA-Driver).
It allows to exchange data between these two in the following manner:
```
{
    "s1": 0,
    "s2": 1,
    "s3": 2,
    "s4": 3,
    "s5": 4
}
```
Where each "s+number" refers to an especific data.
## Installation Guide:
To setup this API, it depends on you hosting service, so i recommend checking with your host provider. Anyway this guide from digitalocean is quite detailed for this case (https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-node-js-application-for-production-on-ubuntu-16-04)
